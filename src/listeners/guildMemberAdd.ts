In GitFitCode, you will find a group of like-minded life-long learners, channels to nerd out about your favorite topics, help each other out, share progress in your development journey, and to have a good time making this a home for yourself!

**We are happy you are here with us**!

Feel free to get to know the other members of the server as well. Head over to the general channel and give a quick intro about who you are, what you like to do in your free time, your favorite tech stack and tools, etc. We want to get to know you!

If you have any questions or concerns please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to **<@${Admin1ID}>** or **<@${Admin2ID}>**.

Please also ensure to update your **GitFitCode** server profile (nickname field) with your name (and optionally add your timezone abbreviation) so it is easier for the community to address you.
Note that updating the name in the server profile **does not** require a Nitro subscription. More info here - https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/4409388345495-Server-Profiles.

Looking forward to seeing your positive impact within our community! ðŸ˜Š`;
